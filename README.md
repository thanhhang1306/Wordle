# Wordle (a recreation by Hang Pham)
The following project provides a recreation of the popular game Wordle, with a word bank of over 3600 words. This was one of Hang's many Java projects during her studies in high school, where she redeveloped games that played a huge role in her childhood. Note that this game has only been tested on Windows OS, not Mac OS. Therefore, playing on Mac OS might lead to incompatible fonts and other issues.

## Guide to Game 
Similar to the popular game Wordle (New York Times), type individual letters to guess the selected 5-letter words. More instructions are available within the game.

## Installation
Use a Java Integrated Development Environment, such as Eclipse, to run the code. Every file but the README.md file, wordlist.xlsx, and files in the bin folder are required for the game to function. 


## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome but please credit Hang Pham. As this project was developed with a relatively intermediate knowledge of programming (based on knowledge taught in school), the code might not be the most optimal. Additionally, note that the game has only been tested on Windows OS, not MAC OS. I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience.


## Credits 
All graphics are created with the Graphics class from Java Library.
